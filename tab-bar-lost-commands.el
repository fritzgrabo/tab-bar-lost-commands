;;; Commentary:

;; The "lost commands" of the tab bar.

;; That is, simple and convenient commands that help with common tab bar
;; use-cases regarding the creation, selection and movement of tabs
;; without the need to use prefix arguments (for reasons of ergonomics:
;; in my own experience at least, frequently needing to type prefix
;; arguments breaks my flow enough to be distracting).

;;; Code:

(defun tab-bar-lost-commands-switch-to-first-tab ()
  "Switch to the first tab."
  (interactive)
  (tab-bar-select-tab 1))

(defun tab-bar-lost-commands-switch-to-last-tab ()
  "Switch to the last tab."
  (interactive)
  (tab-bar-select-tab (length (funcall tab-bar-tabs-function))))

(defun tab-bar-lost-commands-move-tab-first ()
  "Move the current tab to the first position."
  (interactive)
  (tab-bar-move-tab-to 1))

(defun tab-bar-lost-commands-move-tab-backward ()
  "Move the current tab backward by one."
  (interactive)
  (tab-bar-move-tab -1))

(defun tab-bar-lost-commands-move-tab-forward ()
  "Move the current tab forward by one."
  (interactive)
  (tab-bar-move-tab 1))

(defun tab-bar-lost-commands-move-tab-last ()
  "Move the current tab to the last position."
  (interactive)
  (tab-bar-move-tab-to (length (funcall tab-bar-tabs-function))))

(defun tab-bar-lost-commands-switch-to-or-create-tab ()
  "Like `tab-bar-switch-to-tab', but allow for the creation of a new, named tab on the fly."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((tab-names (mapcar (lambda (tab) (alist-get 'name tab)) (funcall tab-bar-tabs-function)))
         (tab-name (completing-read "Switch to tab: " tab-names)))
    (if (member tab-name tab-names)
        (tab-bar-select-tab-by-name tab-name)
      (tab-bar-new-tab)
      (tab-bar-rename-tab tab-name))))
